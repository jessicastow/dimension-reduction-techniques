Miguel's Suggestions for approach

For each method:
* Plot:
    * All populations together
    * Each population separately
* Plot advice:
    * Use semi-transparent points
    * Display label of each cluster at its mean position
* Record the time
* Display time
For plots where there are difficulties:
* Attempt to improve the plot
* State why you think it failed (if you can guess)
* Attempt to fix the issue
* Report the results (either in an appendix, or in the main text if it worked)
Commenting on the results:
* Try to discuss the parameters you used
* Try to explain why it worked (if it did), or, following the above, why it didn't
* Please try to be concise
* Discuss time
* Discuss whether you were able to separate major and/or minor populations
If a method is inappropriate:
* If it's just too slow (like MDS probably is), then take a subset of the points and note that
* If it's not appropriate for the data, then note that and justify that (e.g. SOMs probably not really that useful here)
You could calculate a per-cluster separation statistic:
* For example:
    * For each combination of clusters, calculate the standardized distance between the clusters
    * By "standardized distance," we mean in some sense, e.g. the distance between the means of the clusters divided by the sum of the standard deviations of the clusters
    * These results could be displayed in a table, or a heat map.

Number of methods to try:
* Try different approaches, e.g. linear, distance-preserving (MDS) and non-linear (e.g. isoMDS, autoencoders)
I can make the code above available.
